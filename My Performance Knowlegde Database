Good Nutrition Ideas from Stan Efferding:

(Careful he is a body bilder and wants to become as big as possible, so the idea of eating rice for the fastest digestion might not be ideal to keep your body weight low)

Why i like his approach: 

- he focuses on basics only. 

- he always tries to optimizse all factors going into performance:

MY FACTORS: (sleep, nutrition, activity level, non-physical stress)

he gives lots of good examples like using your calories efficiently, watch important micro nutrition elements, get more consistent(only way to find out if something is working or not)
